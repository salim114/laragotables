## About LaraGoTables

LaraGoTables is a contribution for Laravel community trying to clear the way for the integration of the excellent DataTables JQuery inside projects and to enlarge the use of it, throw its varieties of features (examples) and extensions.

## Laravel introduction

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell. It is a powerful Model-View-Controller (MVC) PHP framework, designed for developers who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications.

## DataTables introduction 

[DataTables](https://datatables.net/) is a powerful Javascript library for adding interaction features to HTML tables, and while simplicity is a core design principle for the project as a whole, it can be quite daunting to get started. In this article I'll introduce the basic concepts that you will need to know to get going with DataTables, and you will find that in a very short space of time you'll be able to create advanced table controls, tuned to your specific requirements.

### Setup:

All you need is to run these commands:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/salim114/laragotables
